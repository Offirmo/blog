## jsDelivr
https://www.jsdelivr.com/
"Built for production"
"multi-CDN for open source projects"
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/package@version/file
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file
https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/prismjs?path=themes


## GitCDN
https://gitcdn.xyz/
The main difference, is our focus on providing the latest commit of a given GitHub file
I'm (not) telling you to go and use it in production
As this service is free, I make no guarantees about Up-time nor do I have anything resembling an SLA.
https://gitcdn.xyz/user/repo/master/file
GitCDN serves raw files directly from GitHub with proper Content-Type headers and a super fast CDN!


## cdnjs
https://cdnjs.com/
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.0/jquery.min.js
The #1 free and open source CDN built to make life easier for developers
-> doesn't support semver :-/


## UNPKG
https://unpkg.com/
unpkg.com/:package@:version/:file
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/unpkg-an-open-source-cdn-for-npm
unpkg is a free, best-effort service and cannot provide any uptime or support guarantees.
if you rely on it to serve files that are crucial to your business, you should probably pay for a host with well-supported infrastructure and uptime guarantees.
